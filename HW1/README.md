### Assignment 1 in NLP course (89-680).

word2vec word embeddings and the output of a Large Language Model (LLM, specifically
ChatGPT). The text below guides you which explorations to perform, and youâ€™re asked to submit
a report which presents the results for all the specified tasks.   

### How to use
The project includes 5 files: `main.py`, `README.md`, `word2vec.pkl`, `twit_model.pkl` and `wiki_news_model.pkl`.   
By running `main.py` script, you will have to choose which coomand you want to excaute: 
- enerating lists of the most similar words
- Polysemous Words
- Synonyms and Antonyms
- The Effect of Different Corpora
- Plotting words in 2D

**Note:** The project using the models: `word2vec-google-news-300`, `glove-wiki-gigaword-200`, `glove-twitter-200`, so it may take a while to load them.
